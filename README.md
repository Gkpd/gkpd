# Hey, I'm Giorgia ðŸ‘‹
_(pronounced Georgia / Jaw-Juh)_

I manage Field Marketing at GitHub for ANZ and ASEAN (South East Asia). 

Previously I worked at two software developers specialising in mining and resources, managing the strategy for the field teams in APAC and Australia.

At GitHub, I collaborate closely with sales, solution engineers and customers to grow our footprint in South APAC. I am continually humbled by how innovative our region is and all the amazing projects happening ðŸš€
